      <p>Many industrial plants are now facing the same challenge â€”<br>their automation systems (DCS, PLC, SCADA) are reaching end of life.<br>Within a few years, spare parts and vendor support will become unavailable.</p>
<p>A new model range for an existing DCS/PLC system may not support older versions of hardware, protocols, and software modules, and its integration will require significant costs, often comparable to replacing the system.</p>
<p>But letâ€™s ask ourselves: is there an alternative?<br>Is it possible to optimize modernization costs?</p>
<p>The most straightforward and logical step might seem to be organizing a tender and requesting proposals from multiple suppliers.</p>
<p>However, what risks does this approach entail? The first that come to mind are:</p>
<p>What risks does this entail? <br>The first things that come to mind are:<br>1. Have all requirements, technical specifications and some special requirements been fully captured in the tender documentation?<br>2. Are proposals from suppliers using different hardware and software platforms comparable in quality?<br>3. Is the planned amount of engineering and commissioning work accurate, or might the project budget be inflated due to incomplete modernization requirements, technical errors, or misjudged workloads?</p>
<p>A well-structured independent review can help avoid such issues and objectively assess the proposed technical solutions.</p>
<p>At PF Automation &amp; Digital Solutions www.pf-ads.com, we provide vendor-neutral technical audits and modernization assessments to support confident, data-driven investment decisions. In many cases, based on system audits and analysis of existing equipment, we can recommend non-obvious yet effective technical solutions that optimize modernization for your production needs.</p>
