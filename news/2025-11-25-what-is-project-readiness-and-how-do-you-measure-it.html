      <p>Most project failures donâ€™t happen inside the execution phase. They happen before the project even begins â€” when organizations assume they are ready, but the fundamentals are missing, unclear, or misaligned.</p>
<p>That is why the concept of Project Readiness matters. It is the discipline of ensuring that the project environment â€” technical, organizational, and human â€” is fully prepared for execution. In other words: Can this project truly start tomorrow without surprises?</p>
<p>Why Project Readiness Matters<br>A â€œreadyâ€� project:</p>
<p>Starts faster and with fewer disruptions<br>Has clear roles, expectations, and decision paths<br>Avoids budget/time overruns caused by ambiguity<br>Reduces risk by validating assumptions early<br>Aligns stakeholders around the same reality â€” not the same hope</p>
<p>Project readiness is not about optimism. It is about verifiable conditions that support a predictable outcome.</p>
<p>The Five Dimensions of Project Readiness<br>1. Scope Readiness<br>A clear and agreed definition of â€œwhat we are buildingâ€�<br>Documented boundaries: in-scope, out-of-scope, constraints<br>Stable requirements and a validated technical concept Key question: Can any stakeholder describe the project in one paragraph consistently?</p>
<p>2. Schedule Readiness<br>A realistic timeline based on real capacities<br>Identified dependencies and resource constraints<br>Buffering strategy for critical-path risks Key question: Is the schedule an honest forecast or a political compromise?</p>
<p>3. Resource Readiness<br>The right people available at the right time<br>Tools, systems, procurement, and vendors prepared<br>Team trained and onboarded before work starts Key question: If we start on Monday, do we actually have everything?</p>
<p>4. Risk Readiness<br>A living risk register with mitigation ownership<br>Early identification of â€œunknownsâ€� and non-technical risks<br>Decision paths for escalation Key question: Do we know what can go wrong â€” and are we ready for it?</p>
<p>5. Stakeholder Readiness<br>Clear governance: roles, responsibilities, decision authorities<br>Alignment on priorities, success criteria, and communication<br>Commitment from all parties â€” internal and external Key question: Is everyone ready to support the project, not just observe it?</p>
<p>How to Measure Project Readiness<br>A practical method is to use a readiness scorecard with measurable indicators across the five dimensions:</p>
<p>DimensionIndicators (examples)Score (0â€“5)Scopeclarity, stability, documentation, approvals0â€“5Schedulerealism, dependencies managed, buffers0â€“5Resourcesteam assigned, vendors onboard, procurement secured0â€“5Risksregister complete, mitigations active, owners defined0â€“5Stakeholdersalignment, governance, communication set0â€“5</p>
<p>A project is considered ready when:</p>
<p>No area is below 3/5, and<br>Overall average is â‰¥ 4.0, and<br>All critical risks have mitigation owners.</p>
<p>This creates transparency. No politics. No guesswork. Just readiness vs. non-readiness.</p>
<p>Project Readiness as a Competitive Advantage<br>Organizations that invest in readiness deliver:</p>
<p>More predictable outcomes<br>Lower execution stress<br>Higher trust between stakeholders<br>Fewer crisis-driven decisions</p>
<p>In fast-moving industries, readiness becomes a strategic differentiator â€” a sign of maturity and operational excellence.</p>
